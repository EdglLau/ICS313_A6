\f0\fs24 \cf0 For Assignment 6, I contributed in making the characters and the locations in our game. I also worked on some of the game-action functions. For example I worked on all of the fighting game actions and I also did some combine functions as well. And I also did the output for the losing game situation. Overall I did at least 50% of the game project while my partner did 50% as well. }
